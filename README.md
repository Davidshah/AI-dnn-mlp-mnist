# Vanilla Deep Neural Network

### Project Overview
In this notebook, we attempt to conceptualize Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and apply one to a common problem. We'll train a version of a DNN called a Multilayer Perceptron (or vanilla network) to classify images from the MNIST database. The [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database contains 70,000 hand-written digits from 0-9 and is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning. If this all sounds confusing so far, don't worry, we'll start at the beginning.

### Install
This project requires **Python 3**.  
Dependencies found in `requirements.txt`.

### Getting started
* Run the notebook `jupyter notebook dnn_mlp_mnist.ipynb`
